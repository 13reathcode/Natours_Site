# Natours | Float layout practice website 

### You can checkout it on [DEMO-NATOURS](https://natours-13reath.netlify.app)

## In order for this to work you need to follow these steps:

1. Install node-sass with dev. dependecies (If you wanna change something) or simply --save (-S).

    `npm i node-sass -D`

2. Install live-server (optinal) locally or globaly (i prefer this).

    `npm i live-server -g`

3. Run both scripts by writing first command bellow | If you skipped step №2 then just write second command

    First: `npm run start` Second: `npm run watch:sass`

#### Other scripts used for build proccess you can checkout in package.json foulder

## Also look into my other projects simply by changing branches/repos ^^
